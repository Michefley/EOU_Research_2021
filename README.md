Realizations for digraphs with a desired signing (if possible).

The purpose of this code is to provide a fast way of proving that a certain graph has a 
Signed Coefficient Support Arbitray Pattern. This will aid us in finding patterns in the 
matrices and/or graphs to see if a data-driven theorem can be produced about which matrices 
are spectrally arbitrary. For now, we are working on non-isomorphic digraphs of 3 vertices 
and allow loops (but not multiple arcs). Next we will look at graphs with 4 vertices.

The programs (main.py) in each subfolder are to establish any valid realizations found by 
running through random rational numbers and checking for the desired signing of each arc weight.
Each realization is written to a file in its repected subfolder (output.txt). A link
to this github repository will be provided in our Latex document.
